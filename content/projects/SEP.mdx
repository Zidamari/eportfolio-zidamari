This project will detail the conceptualisation up to the realisation of the proposed system to tackle a specific problem in regards to the food printing technology in the food industry.
In addition, this article will also highlight the decisions took by the team, our thought process and justifications and lastly, my contribution in this project.


Firstly, we were handed our specifications for the project and a few initial constraints.

The team decided that the first course of action was to gather information on domains that are able to employ the use of this technology and see what functionalities they would like to see the system of food printers exhibit. Therefore, to substatiate this notion of direction, the team did our first iteration of domain analyis to gather insights and information that may benefit us.

Ultimately, we settled on working for the healthcare industry as food printers were being experimented to handle several issues such as texture and nutrition control.

However, during the first meeting with our Professor, this direction was deemed as "straying" and was told to re-read the specification sheet and the team came to realise and agreed upon that the solution has to reside within the food industry and not be used to solve for other domains/industry.



This is when we went back to the drawing board and did the second iteration for our problem space.

This time around, we decided to look at current functionalities provided by a generic food printer and to list them down. This will enable us to understand the current functionalities and limitations of any given food printer. In addition, we are able to see if the added function for innovation will in fact, be new and not something that has already been done by other companies/projects.

Rejected, said was unneccessary to dive too deep this early on and was simply told to pick a new functionality that seemed obvious and work from there instead.

So now we look at Innovation to start so look at shared needs of all domains/industry to facilitate and cater to multiple domains allowing the ability to market out to any given industry and the team redid the list of functionality to be a basic high level representation of any given food printer and to use it simply as a check for innovation. 

The team realised that multiple domains were concerned about food safety and/or contamination such as the commercial sector wanting to avoid lawsuits from their customers due to food poisoning or in the healthcare sector, where contamination is always a risk due to its environment.

Using that, we devised a few ideas and was prepared to have another consultation. 

It was rejected yet again. The key takeaways this time was we were living the "needs" space and was told that there was no basis on whether they would be interested in buying the proposed improved system.
Secondly, our functionality seemed too safe and weak to be deemed an innovation in the eyes of the panel.
Lastly, we learned of new constraints that would apply to this project.

The team now had to decide to alter the path took for this solution or to simply scrap it. Ultimately, the team decided to redo the entire process and risk it for the first Assessment. 

We made use of the new information elicited from the panel and came up with a new flow that would satisfy the constraints imposed on the team.

This time around the team is approaching a demographic of users within the food industry and creating a solution that satisfy their needs in order to create an opportunity for the food industry due to the added novelty in our solution.

The team decided to tackle the issue of eating out for end users diagnosed with Parkinson's. 
[THIS IS STILL AN ONGOING PROJECT AND WILL BE UPDATED ACCORDINGLY]
