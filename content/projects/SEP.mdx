**Overview:**
Our project aimed to conceptualize and realize a food printing system for the food industry.
In our case, the food service industry targetting cafes and restaurants who wishes to be disabled inclusive.
The team overcame initial misdirections and constraints, iterating through multiple problem space analyses and incorporating feedback to refine our solution. 
The team ultimately targeted a specific demographic, end-users diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, to drive innovation within the food industry with an improvement to the novelty of a technology called food printers.

**Key Points:**
- Iterated through short sprints to refine the project direction.
- Conducted domain analyses to gather relevant insights.
- Addressed feedback to remain within the food industry scope.
- Focused on high-level functionalities and innovative solutions.
- Targeted specific needs within the food industry for market relevance.

**My Contribution:**
- Did the sketches for the solution (Slideshow)
- Lead the discussion for the flow of work needed
- Research on relevant domains that affect the food industry
- Decomposed current functionalities of a generic food printer


DISCLAIMER: This is still an ongoing project and changes and modification are still being made.I apologize for the inconvinience.
