**Objective:** <br/>
This project aims to integrates food printing technology, commonly used in the food industry, into the early childhood education domain. 
The goal is to enhance learning capabilities by fostering engaging and interactive scenarios and to increase learning efficiency for young children. 


**Project Aim:** <br/>
- Proof of concept for an improvement to a system
- Integrate food printing technology into domain of early childhood education.

**Objective:** <br/>
Enhance learning capabilities and increase learning efficiency for young children.

**Approach:** <br/>
- Foster engaging and interactive scenarios.
- Utilize innovative technologies such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
- Create a unique educational tool.
- Leverage multi-sensory learning for a better learning experience.


**Project Overview** <br/>
Our project explored integrating food printing technology across various domains to find impactful applications. 
We initially investigated sanitation within the food industry but shifted focus to aiding individuals with disabilities 
and ultimately targeted the education sector. We proposed a system to enhance children's learning through interactive, 
multi-sensory food experiences, aiming to improve user engagement and educational outcomes.

To achieve this, we developed a prototype using the EVEBOT PrintPen as a reference. 
This included visual and auditory stimuli, facilitated by a Raspberry Pi, 
utilizing speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities to promote multi-sensory learning. 
The system involved additive manufacturing and precise hardware integration, 
including NEMA17 stepper motors and L298N motor drivers for automated movement. 
Our solution demonstrated the potential of food printing technology beyond novelty uses, 
offering new market expansion opportunities through innovative applications in education.


**Project Challenges and Solution** <br/>
The team encounter several challenges over the course of the project:
| Challenges | Solutions |
|---|---|
| Lack of Key Stakeholders Involvement | To change focus to be a Proposal to EVEBOT |
| Short Schedule | Short Sprints with defined goals and reminders to mitigate inefficiency |
| Limited Budget Allocated | Complexity of systems reduced, High focus on Core Functionalities highlighted in Concept Models |

**Analysis and Future Works** <br/>
| Issue | Reasoning | Future Works |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Vibration and Instability | Due to incompatility of hardware parts | Belt and Pulley system instead of Lead Screw|
| Positioning | Inconsistent Printing Output | <li>Use of vision to detect object exact coordinates</li> <li>Place markings to indicate food printer print area</li>|
| Calibration | <li>Hassle for Operator</li><li>Incosistent Output due to Alignment Issues</li> | Usage of a depth camera to apply z-axis auto calibration|
| No API Access | Project Constraint | <li>Make our own application</li> <li>Collaboration with EVEBOT</li>|
| Safety | Prototype has minimal safety features | Include children safety designs into the system|


**Reflection** <br/>
- Managed a complex project with evolving constraints, requiring constant focus and dedication.
- Fostered a positive team environment and mitigated discord to maintain project momentum and stakeholder satisfaction.
- Balanced stakeholder input with project feasibility, selecting and prioritizing needs to align with constraints and team capabilities.
- Gained experience in navigating project management challenges, including balancing ambition with practical constraints and handling diverse team dynamics.


**My Contribution:** <br/>
