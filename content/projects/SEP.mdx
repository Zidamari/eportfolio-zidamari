This project will detail the conceptualisation up to the realisation of the proposed system to tackle a specific problem in regards to the food printing technology in the food industry.
In addition, this article will also highlight the decisions took by the team, our thought process and justifications and lastly, my contribution in this project.


Firstly, we were handed our specifications for the project and a few initial constraints.

The team decided that the first course of action was to gather information on domains that are able to employ the use of this technology and see what functionalities they would like to see the system of food printers exhibit. Therefore, to substatiate this notion of direction, the team did our first iteration of domain analyis to gather insights and information that may benefit us.

Ultimately, we settled on working for the healthcare industry as food printers were being experimented to handle several issues such as texture and nutrition control.

However, during the first meeting with our Professor, this direction was deemed as "straying" and was told to re-read the specification sheet and the team came to realise and agreed upon that the solution has to reside within the food industry and not be used to solve for other domains/industry.



This is when we went back to the drawing board and did the second iteration for our problem space.

This time around, we decided to look at current functionalities provided by a generic food printer and to list them down. This will enable us to understand the current functionalities and limitations of any given food printer. In addition, we are able to see if the added function for innovation will in fact, be new and not something that has already been done by other companies/projects.

Rejected, said was too deep -> So now we look at Innovation to start so look at shared needs -> rejected -> so now looking at food domain and also adding new function.
