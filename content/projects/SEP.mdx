Finalized System


**Objective:** <br/>
This project aims to integrates food printing technology, commonly used in the food industry, into the early childhood education domain. 
The goal is to enhance learning capabilities by fostering engaging and interactive scenarios and to increase learning efficiency for young children. 


**My Contribution:** <br/>
- Led the team as Project Leader from start to finish, ensuring smooth team operations and resolving issues.
- Led the discussions on Systems Engineering Concepts
- Did the initial Microprocessor setup and other hardware components
- Designed majority of the parts on SOLIDWORKS and was responsible for the physical design
- Fabricated majority of the parts as specified on technical drawings


**Project Overview** <br/>
The team upon exploration wishes to integrate multi-sensory learning features to improve the learning experience of children. 
Furthermore, the team feel the benefits it would bring to the stakeholders involved would be novel.
Secondly, this project would serve as a improvement to the food printer, PrintPen and also serve as a proposal to increase revenue by tapping into another domain for EVEBOT.

**Project Challenges and Solution** <br/>
The team encounter several challenges over the course of the project:
| Challenges | Solutions |
|---|---|
| Lack of Key Stakeholders Involvement | To change focus to be a Proposal to EVEBOT |
| Short Schedule | Short Sprints with defined goals and reminders to mitigate inefficiency |
| Limited Budget Allocated | Complexity of systems reduced, High focus on Core Functionalities highlighted in Concept Models |


**Analysis and Future Works** <br/>
| Issue | Reasoning | Future Works |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Vibration and Instability | Due to incompatility of hardware parts | Belt and Pulley system instead of Lead Screw|
| Positioning | Inconsistent Printing Output | <li>Use of vision to detect object exact coordinates</li> <li>Place markings to indicate food printer print area</li>|
| Calibration | <li>Hassle for Operator</li><li>Incosistent Output due to Alignment Issues</li> | Usage of a depth camera to apply z-axis auto calibration|
| No API Access | Project Constraint | <li>Make our own application</li> <li>Collaboration with EVEBOT</li>|
| Safety | Prototype has minimal safety features | Include children safety designs into the system|


**Reflection** <br/>
- Managed a complex project with evolving constraints, requiring constant focus and dedication.
- Fostered a positive team environment and mitigated discord to maintain project momentum and stakeholder satisfaction.
- Balanced stakeholder input with project feasibility, selecting and prioritizing needs to align with constraints and team capabilities.
- Gained experience in navigating project management challenges, including balancing ambition with practical constraints and handling diverse team dynamics.


**Proficiencies** <br/>
These are skills that have been gained or improved over the course of the project.

| Hard Skills | Soft Skills |
|---|---|
| Computer Aided Design | Leadership Abilities |
| Fabrication/Workshop Skills | Critical Thinking |
|Coding (Python, Bash, ADB) | Systems Engineering |
|Industrial Design |
