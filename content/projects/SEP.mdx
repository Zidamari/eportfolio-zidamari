This project outlines the conceptualization and ongoing realization of a proposed system designed to address a specific challenge in food printing technology within the food industry. It will also highlight the decisions made by the team, our thought processes and justifications, and my individual contributions to the project.

Initially, we were provided with project specifications and a few constraints.

The team's first course of action was to gather information on domains that could benefit from this technology and identify desired functionalities for the food printing system. To substantiate our direction, we conducted our first iteration of domain analysis to gather insights and information that could benefit us.

Ultimately, we initially focused on the healthcare industry, as food printers were being experimented with to address issues such as texture and nutrition control.

However, during our first meeting with our professor, this direction was deemed as "straying" from the specifications. We re-read the specification sheet and agreed that the solution had to remain within the food industry and not extend to other domains.

We then revisited our approach and conducted a second iteration of our problem space analysis.

This time, we decided to examine the current functionalities provided by generic food printers and compile a list. This would help us understand existing capabilities and limitations, ensuring any new function we proposed would be innovative and not already implemented by other companies or projects.

However, this approach was also deemed unnecessary at this stage, and we were advised to pick an obvious functionality and develop it further.

We shifted our focus to innovation by identifying shared needs across multiple domains, aiming to create a system that could cater to various industries. We revised our list of functionalities to represent a high-level overview of a typical food printer, using it as a baseline for innovation.

The team identified that multiple domains, including the commercial sector and healthcare, were concerned about food safety and contamination. This led us to brainstorm ideas addressing these concerns in a food printing system.

During our next consultation, our approach was again rejected. The key feedback was that we were not addressing the core needs of the food industry, lacked a basis for market interest in the proposed system, and our functionality was considered too safe and weak to be deemed innovative. We also learned of new constraints applicable to the project.

Faced with these challenges, the team decided to revisit our approach and re-evaluate our solution for the first assessment.

Utilizing the new information elicited from the panel, we developed a new approach that satisfied the imposed constraints.

This time, we targeted a demographic within the food industry, focusing on creating a solution that addresses their specific needs, thereby creating an opportunity for innovation in the food industry.

The team ultimately decided to address the challenge of dining out for end users diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Our project is currently ongoing, and we continue to refine our approach based on feedback and new insights.
